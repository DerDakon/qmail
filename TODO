do some serious coverage testing, preferably under Purify, without alloc slop
replace INTERNALS and THOUGHTS with a real paper describing qmail
reorganize qmail-inject to do most rw on characters, not tokens
allow concurrency over 255
handle IPv6
turn qmail-upq into a more serious queue-moving utility
expand strerr coverage
rewrite everything from scratch
maybe allow root to clear tcpto on the fly
