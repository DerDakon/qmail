.TH qmail-command 8
.SH NAME
qmail-command \- user-specified mail delivery program
.SH SYNOPSIS
in
.BR .qmail\fIext :
.B |\fIcommand
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-local
will, upon your request,
feed each incoming mail message through a program of your choice.

When a mail message arrives,
.B qmail-local
runs
.B sh -c \fIcommand
in your home directory.
It makes the message available on 
.IR command 's
standard input.

.B WARNING:
The mail message does not begin with
.BR qmail-local 's
usual
.B Return-Path
and
.B Delivered-To
lines.

Note that
.B qmail-local
uses the same file descriptor for every delivery
in your
.B .qmail
file, so it is not safe for
.I command
to fork a child that
reads the message in the background while the parent exits.

.IR command 's
exit codes are interpreted as follows:
0 means that the delivery was successful;
99 means that the delivery was successful,
but that
.B qmail-local
should ignore all further delivery instructions;
100 means that the delivery failed permanently (hard error);
111 means that the delivery failed but should be tried again
in a little while (soft error).
Currently 64, 65, 70, 76, 77, 78, and 112 are considered hard errors,
and all other codes are considered soft errors,
but
.I command
should avoid relying on this.

.IR command .
