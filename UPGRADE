SAVE COPIES OF YOUR OUTGOING MAIL! Like any other piece of software (and
information generally), the qmail system comes with NO WARRANTY. It's
much more secure and reliable than sendmail, but that's not saying much.


Here's how to upgrade from qmail 1.00 to qmail 1.01. This procedure will
overwrite the old qmail binaries. Furthermore, it may begin delivering
messages from the queue before you have had a chance to test it.


WARNING: The qmail-start command line has changed.


Before starting, compare conf* to your old conf*, and make any necessary
changes. Do not copy your old conf*; the baseline has changed.


How to install:

 1. Compile the programs:
       # make
 2. Create the formatted man pages, *.0:
       # make man
 3. Inform your users that mail will not be accepted for a few minutes.
 4. Disable deliveries by killing your old qmail-send. Wait for it to
    print ``exiting'' in the log.
 5. Disable SMTP service by commenting out the smtp line in inetd.conf;
    kill -HUP your inetd. (If you are using tcpserver, simply kill -STOP
    your tcpserver.) Wait for current qmail-smtpd processes to die. (If
    you are running a QMTP server, disable that too.)
 6. Install the new binaries and man pages:
       # rm /var/qmail/bin/* /var/qmail/man/*/*
       # make setup
 7. Run instcheck to make sure it doesn't print any warnings:
       # make check
 8. Reenable deliveries:
       # env - PATH="/var/qmail/bin:$PATH" \
       qmail-start ./Mailbox splogger qmail &
    Make sure to include the ./ in ./Mailbox.
 9. Insert ./Mailbox into the qmail-start line in your boot scripts.
10. Reenable SMTP service by restoring the smtp line in inetd.conf; kill
    -HUP your inetd. (If you are using tcpserver, simply kill -CONT your
    tcpserver. If you are running a QMTP server, reenable that too.)


How to test (steps 11-17 can be done before step 10):

11. Look for a
            qmail: running
    line in syslog. (The big number is a splogger timestamp.)
12. Local-local test: Send yourself an empty message. (Replace ``me''
    with your username. Make sure to include the ``to:'' colon.)
       % echo to: me | /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject
    The message will show up immediately in ~/Mailbox, and syslog will
    show something like this:
            qmail: new msg 53 
            qmail: info msg 53: bytes 246 from <me@domain> qp 20345 uid 666
            qmail: starting delivery 1: msg 53 to local me@domain 
            qmail: delivery 1: success: did_1+0+0/
            qmail: end msg 53 
    (53 is an inode number; 20345 is a process ID; your numbers will
    probably be different.)
13. Local-error test: Send a message to a nonexistent local address.
       % echo to: nonexistent | /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject
            qmail: new msg 53 
            qmail: info msg 53: bytes 246 from <me@domain> qp 20351 uid 666
            qmail: starting delivery 2: msg 53 to local nonexistent@domain
            qmail: delivery 2: failure: No_such_address.__#5.1.1_/
	    qmail: bounce msg 53 qp 20357
            qmail: end msg 53 
            qmail: new msg 54 
            qmail: info msg 54: bytes 743 from <> qp 20357 uid 666
            qmail: starting delivery 3: msg 54 to local me@domain
            qmail: delivery 3: success: did_1+0+0/
            qmail: end msg 54 
    You will now have a bounce message in ~/Mailbox.
14. Local-remote test: Send an empty message to your account on another
    machine.
       % echo to: me@wherever | /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject
            qmail: new msg 53 
            qmail: info msg 53: bytes 246 from <me@domain> qp 20372 uid 666
            qmail: starting delivery 4: msg 53 to remote me@wherever
            qmail: delivery 4: success: 1.2.3.4_accepted_message./...
            qmail: end msg 53 
    There will be a pause between ``starting delivery'' and ``success'';
    SMTP is slow. Check that the message is in your mailbox on the other
    machine.
15. Local-postmaster test: Send mail to postmaster, any capitalization.
       % echo to: POSTmaster | /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject
    Look for the message in ~alias/Mailbox.
16. Double-bounce test: Send a message with a completely bad envelope.
       % /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject -f nonexistent
       To: unknownuser
       Subject: testing

       This is a test. This is only a test.
       %
    (Use end-of-file, not dot, to end the message.) Look for the double
    bounce in ~alias/Mailbox.
17. Group membership test:
       % cat > ~me/.qmail-groups
       |groups >> MYGROUPS; exit 0
       % /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject me-groups < /dev/null
       % cat ~me/MYGROUPS
    MYGROUPS will show your normal gid and nothing else. (Under Solaris,
    make sure to use /usr/ucb/groups; /usr/bin/groups is broken.)
18. SMTP server test: Forge some mail locally via SMTP.
       % telnet 127.0.0.1 25
       Trying 127.0.0.1...
       Connected to 127.0.0.1.
       Escape character is '^]'.
       220 domain ESMTP
       helo dude
       250-domain
       250-PIPELINING
       250 8BITMIME
       mail <me@domain>
       250 ok
       rcpt <me@domain>
       250 ok

       This is a test.
       .
       250 ok 812345679 qp 12345
       quit
       221 domain
       Connection closed by foreign host.
       %
    Look for the message in your mailbox.
19. Remote-local test: Send yourself some mail from another machine.
20. Remote-error test: I think you can figure this one out.
21. UA test: Try sending mail, first to a local account, then to a
    remote account, with your normal user agent.
22. Remote-postmaster test: Send mail from another machine to
    PoStMaStEr@domain. Look for the message in ~alias/Mailbox.


That's it! To report success:
       % ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) \
         | mail djb-qst@koobera.math.uic.edu
Replace First M. Last with your name. If you have questions about qmail,
